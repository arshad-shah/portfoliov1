      <h1>BENEFITS OF AI</h1>

          <h6>A Daigram illustrating our awareness to A I</h6>
          <h6>Taken from <a href="https://www.atomikresearch.co.uk/rise-of-the-robots-public-opinions-of-ai/"> >>atomikresearch<< </a> </h6>
        </aside>

        <p>
          <h1> Artificial Intelligence has both benefits and Dangers associated with it, we will talk about its benefits here</h1>
          Sometime its benefits outweight the dangers but if spoken truly every new innovation in technology is a danger first to all humans <i>(The First Car was considered witchcraft and its owner a witch who by some bad luck was a woman)</i>.
          therefore its very hard to get a good opinion on things at first.
          <br>
          <br>
          But all that aside even with the narrow A I we have developed so far.
          <br>
          it has revolutionized our work in medicine, mechanics, meteological understanding and the list goes on.
          <br>
          Due to lack of awareness about <strong> Artificial Intelligence </strong> a lot of people dont know about.
          <br>
          And the small amount that do know is due to the film industry.
          <br>
          who do not depict a good image of A.I.
            <br>
            <br>
          A study done in United Kingdom show this in simple but detailed daigram.
          <br>
          The question was given to more then 2000 adults of various ages and below are the answers that Atomik Reseach got.

          <br>
          Based on that we can assume that a very small number of our society even know about A.I,
          <br>
          Therefore more education in the matter is needed but we all know its at the mercy of the governement of every respective country to do so.

            <h1><q> As more and more artificial intelligence is entering into the world, more and more emotional intelligence must enter into leadership.</q>
              <br> -- Amit Ray, Famous AI Scientist --
              <br> Author of Compassionate Artificial Intelligence</h1>
          </div>

          <br>
          The above qoute really shows the reality of the ignorence of the nowadays governement and regulatory authorities in general.
          <br>
          Its true to a fact because they dont care as <strong> A I </strong> is a field that they think is not important.
          <br>
          so they don't regulate it.
          <br>
          A.I is beneficial as long as we as humans know what we are doing, because it can be debated that guns are beneficial for personel security but if a gun is given to a morally bad person who is known for causing harm to society the consequences are devastating.
          <br>
          so therefore it is important without a doubt to regulate its use in any field.
          <br>
          because if we dont then the figure below describes our human race in a simple way.

            <h6>A Ted Talk by Kai Fu Lee regarding benefits of A I</h6>
            <h6>Taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajGgd9Ld-Wc"> >>Youtube<< </a> </h6>

          <br>
          In this video Kai Fu Lee (An Artificial Intelligence Expert ) explains the benefits of A.I to Humanity.

          <br>
          The last is probably because if we use it correctly we can increase our knowledge base by <strong> <b> Billion folds </b> </strong> but if we dont then the last one will come true.
          <br>
          <br>
          step 5 can be avoided through care full consideration of developement and usage of A.I itself, because technically we are playing <strong> <b>GOD</b> </strong> here.
          <br>
          which always goes wrong because we are not Gods so mistakes are very easy to make, and especially when we dont know what we are dealing with.
          <br>
          <br>

          <h1><q> Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history.
            br
             Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks.</q>
          <br>
            -- Stephen Hawking, Famous Theoretical Physicist --
            <br>
             Cosmologist, and Author.</h1>
             <br>
            This another great qoute from Dr.Hawking himself.
            <br>
            its true to every word because human error is a massive factor every where and machine on the other hand have very tiny error factor in a job or task. so even if we succeed to make a loyal machine.
            <br>
            our mistakes may cause our demise.
